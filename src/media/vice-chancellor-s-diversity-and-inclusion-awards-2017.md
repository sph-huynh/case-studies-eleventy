We were recognised for our efforts by the Vice-Chancellor in 2017.<br><br><br><p>'Sophia goes on to share that it isn’t just a matter of addressing one challenge. Whilst there’s an emphasis on women in IT, the group wants to extend their message to address other diversity concerns in the technical landscape in Australia. There isn’t just one way to effect change. <br><br>We need to recognise what we have the capacity to do and act on all factors that we are not comfortable accepting. Whether this be demystifying tech to younger students, ensuring high school students know that there are people like them in the workforce, reiterating to tertiary students that it is okay to seek support, and that support will continue throughout their time at Monash, Sophia explains.'</p>"
