Here are my thoughts on how companies can successfully embrace and adopt the agile approach.<br><br><br><h3>How agile delivers better customer outcomes</h3><p>Evolving consumer behaviors have led to a rising focus on customer-centric disciplines, such as user experience, customer experience, and service design. In order to truly be ‘customer-centric’ in product development (that being, to design <em>for</em> the customer, <em>with</em> the customer in mind), customer validation is imperative. <br><br>The reality is that we do not know our customers as well as we think we do. Yes, we should design products that we ourselves would use, but we also need to recognise that our needs and challenges do not reflect the needs and challenges of <em>all</em> our customers. This is why the constant realignment and readjustment that Agile methodologies encourage, suits customer-centric projects so well.</p>'
