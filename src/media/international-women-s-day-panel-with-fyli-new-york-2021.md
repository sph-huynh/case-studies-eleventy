  bodyContent: "'It''s two things: 1. The exposure - understanding the knowledge...2. The opportunity to take action.. the SDGs are often seen as these abstract goals - they are hard to remember - we should be making them relatable. How do you make a better world? How can we be happy? How can we just care for each other? Making these goals relatable is important to sustainability education and opening opportunities."
