  bodyContent: '<strong>Key stakeholder pain points<br></strong>There were two challenge streams that I discovered:<br><strong>Network Managers</strong> were typically time-poor and lacked expertise in marketing or branding. This left marketing as unattended in most networks.<br><strong>End-website users</strong> would come from a variety of backgrounds with different goals. Most Network Managers would only focus on one goal (and sometimes neither).<br>Therefore the challenge statement I decided on addressing was:<br><br>How might we simplify marketing for Network Managers, so they could laser-focus on key stakeholders?<br>Full disclaimer - marketing should be done properly in order to reach its full potential. But in this case, regardless of what I would create, the Managers would not have time to learn something from scratch or bring on more people to help. So the key priority was to<br>Define some baseline personas/focuses<br>Create plug/play style material depending on the capacity of the Manager'

  bodyContent: '<strong>Stream 1 User Research: </strong>There was little user research done on the end-users of the network materials. So I spent time doing user research first to separate the concerns and goals of the end-user from the Network Manager, and from the global team.<br><br><strong>Stream 2 Materials Requirements: </strong>Whilst the brief originally had a website and newsletter templates, I found very quickly during the research phase that a big gap was actually understanding the relevance of marketing activities to the overall goal of the network. Therefore, I needed to flesh out the information/resources end-users wanted across the materials Managers already create/could have on their website, in order to define the final feature set'
