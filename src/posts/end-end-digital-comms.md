  textcontent: "<p><strong>Key stakeholder pain points</strong></p><p>There were two
    challenge streams that I discovered:</p><p><strong>Network Managers </strong>were
    typically time-poor and lacked expertise in marketing or branding. This left marketing
    as unattended in most networks.</p><p><strong>End-website users </strong>would
    come from a variety of backgrounds with different goals. Most Network Managers
    would only focus on one goal (and sometimes neither).</p><p></p><p>Therefore the
    challenge statement I decided on addressing was:</p><p><strong><em>How might we
    simplify marketing for Network Managers, so they could laser-focus on key stakeholders?</em></strong></p><p>Full
    disclaimer - marketing should be done properly in order to reach its full potential.
    But in this case, regardless of what I would create, the Managers would not have
    time to learn something from scratch or bring on more people to help. So the key
    priorities was to</p><ul><li><p>Define some baseline personas/focuses</p></li><li><p>Create
    plug/play style material depending on the capacity of the Manager</p></li></ul>"
