  textcontent: "<p><strong>Key stakeholder pain points</strong></p><p>There were two
    challenge streams that I discovered:</p><p><strong>Network Managers </strong>were
    typically time-poor and lacked expertise in marketing or branding. This left marketing
    as unattended in most networks.</p><p><strong>End-website users </strong>would
    come from a variety of backgrounds with different goals. Most Network Managers
    would only focus on one goal (and sometimes neither).</p><p></p><p>Therefore the
    challenge statement I decided on addressing was:</p><p><strong><em>How might we
    simplify marketing for Network Managers, so they could laser-focus on key stakeholders?</em></strong></p><p>Full
    disclaimer - marketing should be done properly in order to reach its full potential.
    But in this case, regardless of what I would create, the Managers would not have
    time to learn something from scratch or bring on more people to help. So the key
    priorities was to</p><ul><li><p>Define some baseline personas/focuses</p></li><li><p>Create
    plug/play style material depending on the capacity of the Manager</p></li></ul>"

  subtitle: Challenge Streams
  textcontent: "<p><strong>Stream 1 User Research: </strong>There was little user
    research done on the end-users of the network materials. So I spent time doing
    user research first to separate the concerns and goals of the end-user from the
    Network Manager, and from the global team.</p><p><strong>Stream 2 Materials Requirements:
    </strong>Whilst the brief originally had a website and newsletter templates, I
    found very quickly during the research phase that a big gap was actually understanding
    the relevance of marketing activities to the overall goal of the network. Therefore,
    I needed to flesh out the information/resources end-users wanted across the materials
    Managers already create/could have on their website, in order to define the final
    feature set.</p>"
- title: "<p>Outcome</p>"
  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p><strong>Personas and goals to direct Manager's focus</strong></p><ul><li><p>Delivered
    personas, example user flows, goals and linked to suggested information to display
    on the website. This provided Managers with a framework to direct their effort
    towards the stakeholders most relevant to their network goals.</p></li><li><p>Provided
    the research and insights to the global Networks Team, who can now leverage insights
    from real users - saving them time and providing data for future problem solving.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Website
    and marketing templates</strong></p><ul><li><p>Reusable and customisable templates
    allow Managers to plug and play, therefore reducing time required </p></li></ul><p></p>"
