    challenge streams that I discovered:</p><p><strong>Network Managers </strong>were

    disclaimer - marketing should be done properly in order to reach its full potential.

    time to learn something from scratch or bring on more people to help. So the key

  textcontent: "<p><strong>Stream 1 User Research: </strong>There was little user
    research done on the end-users of the network materials. So I spent time doing
    user research first to separate the concerns and goals of the end-user from the
    Network Manager, and from the global team.</p><p><strong>Stream 2 Materials Requirements:
    </strong>Whilst the brief originally had a website and newsletter templates, I
    found very quickly during the research phase that a big gap was actually understanding
    the relevance of marketing activities to the overall goal of the network. Therefore,
    I needed to flesh out the information/resources end-users wanted across the materials
    Managers already create/could have on their website, in order to define the final
    feature set.</p>"

    personas, example user flows, goals and linked to suggested information to display

    towards the stakeholders most relevant to their network goals.</p></li><li><p>Provided
