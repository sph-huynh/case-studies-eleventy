  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>The project followed the Double Diamond approach, as we needed
    to understand what the full scope of the challenges was, before heading into solutioning.</p><p>We
    first aimed to understand as much as possible - this meant interviewing stakeholders,
    exploring existing information, and researching the competition.</p><p>Objectives
    were defined at the end of the Define stage, allowing us to descope items that
    wouldn't fit into our timeline or we didn't have resources for.</p>"

  textcontent: "<p>A problem we uncovered was that many volunteers felt disempowered
    due to their position title, and not knowing where their authority started or
    ended. It became very clear that volunteers had similar yet distinct challenges
    depending on what role they played in the organisation. Therefore, a large emphasis
    on representation (of roles) in ideation and prioritisation sessions.</p><p>This
    included equal representation in discovery (interviewing), challenge priortisation
    and risk assessment, solution ideation, <em>and</em> solution priortisation.</p>"
- title: "<p>Outcome</p>"
  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>The initiative provided the leadership team with a clear roadmap
    and a number of initiatives to improve their internal operations.</p><p>For the
    local representatives, this also provided the opportunity to have challenges that
    were traditionally had no clear platform to voice, to directly shape the internal
    operations strategy of the organisation.</p><p>It also provided an opportunity
    for a number of the global governance team members to build relationships with
    the local representatives 1-1.</p><p>Since the review, 6 initiatives have started.
    2 have already been completed.</p>"

overview: "<p>This project aimed to understand volunteer challenges and needs, to
  identify key opportunities to uplift their ability to make an impact.</p><p>The
  exact challenges were unclear, but we did know that there was a need to improve
  operational efficiency as volunteers felt their work was hindered by operations.</p><p>We
  eventually outlined the following objectives:</p><ul><li><p>Opportunities to uplift
  internal operation efficiency</p></li><li><p>Informational and decision making flow</p></li><li><p>Leveraging
  resources</p></li></ul>"
