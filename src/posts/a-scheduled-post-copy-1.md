  textcontent: "<p>Co-developed the Immersive Learning strategy and validation framework,
    producing a number of educational and diagnostic assets for the client to assess
    different types of Extended Reality (i.e. AR, VR, MR) technologies to use in their
    internal training. The client has since used our prioritisation framework to successfully
    allocate a budget of $500k to create a VR learning experience pilot.</p><p><br></p>"

  textcontent: "<p>We ran a number stakeholder interviews and desktop research to
    further understand the training use cases and potential application with technology.
    We prioritised the use cases and dug deeper into implementation costs in order
    to form a roadmap. I led the technical track, including implementation research.</p><p><br></p>"

  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>A utilities company has over 2000 employees that work in highly
    specialised and compliance heavy work. They are required to put safety first and
    also have a number of trainings that are regulated by a third party. Our client
    was considering using immersive learning technologies to better improve the retention
    and access to important knowledge. However they lacked the expertise to understand
    how they could assess the suitability of this technology.</p>"
