  textcontent: "<p>A utilities company has over 2000 employees that work in highly
    specialised and compliance heavy work. They are required to put safety first and
    also have a number of trainings that are regulated by a third party. Our client

    and access to important knowledge. However they lacked the expertise to understand
    how they could assess the suitability of this technology.</p>"
