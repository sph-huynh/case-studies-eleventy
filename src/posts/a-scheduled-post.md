The client faced many challenges - bureaucratic processes, yet many structures were ad hoc and is predominately full of volunteers around the world, management and compliance were cited as a challenge by senior leaders.

The brief provided was to explore:

* Opportunities to uplift internal operation efficiency
* Informational and decision making flow
* Leveraging resources

This case study uses a Design Thinking approach to building a strategy around improving internal processes at a nonprofit.

**Stakeholders**

The project focused on the workflows of the leadership team, which comprised of two groups: the local representatives, and the global governance teams.

#### Approach

#### Discover

The discovery phase was about trying to understand as much as possible - this meant interviewing stakeholders, exploring existing information, and researching the competition.

The types of documentation we explored were anything related to process, organisational structure, or governance.

We also interviewed some third party individuals from similar but external organisations - specifically those that were similar in reach (global nature via volunteers), structure (local vs global governance), and social impact related (for young people).

Internal interview invitations were sent out to a broad range of leadership members, with the aim to cover as many different types of people as possible - duration of stay, team, position, geography, etc.

In total we ran 29 interviews:

* 4 team members
* 15 leadership team members
* 2 external parties
* 8 deep dive topic consultations

We found that team memberâ€™s ambition, clarity of role and motivations depended on the level of support they received.

There was a clear lack of resources and process documentation, leading to an ad hoc culture.
