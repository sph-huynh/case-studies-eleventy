**Case Study Overview**

I ran a lean review to explore potential improvements across a recruitment journey both for increasing efficiency for the business and the experience of the candidates. This experience was critical to the client as recruitment was heavily marketed, impacting their branding and reputation. 

**Target audience:**

* Candidates
  * Mostly students or young professionals
  * From around the world
  * Mostly online, with the exception of internships being done in person
* Recruiter
  * Often people who have never played an HR role before, nor formed teams before
  * Lack of international context

#### **Challenge statements**

After the discovery phase, I found that there were key challenges for both stakeholders.

**Candidate**

Two key pain points for candidates were a) the duration the process took, and b) understanding the skills required for the role.

The duration for recruitment could take up to 2-3 months, with little visibility around what the process looks like.

**Recruiter**

On the flip side, pain points for recruiters were a) not finding enough candidates as b) candidates often did not have the relevant experience. Additionally, the process for recruiting candidates was manual and repetitive, creating a feeling of tediousness.

The challenge statement I decided on addressing was something along the lines of:

_How might we make it easier for teams to find suitable candidates?*_

Something we had to acknowledge was that the content in job descriptions never seemed to be accurate to the actual role, so a secondary challenge was:

_How might we help candidates understand how they would contribute to SDSN Youth?_

Immediately, I could see an opportunity for an experience uplift in a number of areas.

#### **Stream 1** Marketing: Content uplift

Challenges:

* Looking at the application, there was often a lot of jargon.
* Descriptions of activities, but not necessarily the responsibilities of the role - nor a description of the type of skills being sought out
* Job descriptions often were advertised for teams, rather than roles - leading to candidates catering their message to the team, but not the skills that the interviewer would look for.
* 88% of volunteers/staff said their role was _at least_ a little different to the job description they applied for
* Average time spent in key early stages was 47 days in Video Interview/Questionnaire, 17 days in Feedback 1

#### **Stream 2** Recruiter: Process definition

Some challenges I discovered after mapping out the recruitment processes were that:

* Many candidates would ask for paid internships when paid internships only made 1% of the available roles.
* These people tended to never satisfy the visa requirements
* Sometimes the recruitment team would select a group of candidates and place them into teams without identifying the skills needed.
* The pipeline of talent was small - and many channels were utilised
* The recruitment platform database was unorganised and without a clear process.

Key numbers:

* The average recruitment process was 97 days
* With 61% taking over a month
* 23% taking over two months
* There was 13 steps in the recruitment process, all done manually.

#### **Stream 3** Automation: Templates & Pipeline

In order to supplement my own findings, I did some research into Recruitment best practices from other companies.

* Comparing the current state with best practices from the market showed gaps in processes and templates
* There was inconsistency in the vetting process, recruiters often using personal judgment _alone_ to pick candidates (rather than agreeing on a scorecard), leaving no standardisation of assessments, and no documenting of lessons learned after the candidate had started their role.

#### Solution

I took the inputs and redesigned the process, structures for creating job descriptions and uplifting the recruitment marketing.
