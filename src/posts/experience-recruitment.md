  bodyContent: 'There were two challenge streams that I discovered:<br><strong>Candidates</strong>
    would spend an awful amount of time in the recruitment process (sometimes up to
    2-3 months, with little visibility around what the process looks like.).<br><strong>Recruiters</strong>
    were often under-trained, under-resourced, and needed to do many tedious and manual
    steps.<br><br>Therefore the challenge statement I decided on addressing was: <strong><em>How
    might we make it easier for teams to find suitable candidates? How might we help
    candidates understand how they would contribute to SDSN Youth?</em></strong>'

  bodyContent: "<strong>Stream 1 Marketing: Content uplift,</strong> aimed to address
    non-descriptive job descriptions and a lack of insight for what the roles actually
    entailed.<br><br>88% of volunteers/staff said their role was <em>at least</em>
    a little different to the job description they applied for<br>Average time spent
    in key early stages was 47 days in Video Interview/Questionnaire, 17 days in Feedback
    1<br>In sum, quite a long time with no communication.<br><br><strong>Stream 2
    Recruiter: Process definition</strong>, addressed the process optimisation. The
    average recruitment process was 97 days with 61% taking over a month23% taking
    over two months.<br>There were 13 steps in the recruitment process, all done manually.<br><br><strong>Stream
    3 Automation: Templates &amp; Pipeline</strong>, aimed to supplement my own findings
    with best practices from other companies. Because ultimately, I am not a recruiter
    by trade and another perspective would be beneficial to the design process."
