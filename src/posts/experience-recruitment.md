overview: "<p>I ran a lean review to explore potential improvements across a recruitment
  journey both for increasing efficiency for the business and the experience of the
  candidates. This experience was critical to the client as recruitment was heavily
  marketed, impacting their branding and reputation.</p>"

#### **Challenge statements**

After the discovery phase, I found that there were key challenges for both stakeholders.

#### **Stream 1** Marketing: Content uplift

Challenges:

* Looking at the application, there was often a lot of jargon.
* Descriptions of activities, but not necessarily the responsibilities of the role - nor a description of the type of skills being sought out
* Job descriptions often were advertised for teams, rather than roles - leading to candidates catering their message to the team, but not the skills that the interviewer would look for.
* 88% of volunteers/staff said their role was _at least_ a little different to the job description they applied for
* Average time spent in key early stages was 47 days in Video Interview/Questionnaire, 17 days in Feedback 1

#### **Stream 2** Recruiter: Process definition

Some challenges I discovered after mapping out the recruitment processes were that:

* Many candidates would ask for paid internships when paid internships only made 1% of the available roles.
* These people tended to never satisfy the visa requirements
* Sometimes the recruitment team would select a group of candidates and place them into teams without identifying the skills needed.
* The pipeline of talent was small - and many channels were utilised
* The recruitment platform database was unorganised and without a clear process.

Key numbers:

* The average recruitment process was 97 days
* With 61% taking over a month
* 23% taking over two months
* There was 13 steps in the recruitment process, all done manually.

#### **Stream 3** Automation: Templates & Pipeline

In order to supplement my own findings, I did some research into Recruitment best practices from other companies.

* Comparing the current state with best practices from the market showed gaps in processes and templates
* There was inconsistency in the vetting process, recruiters often using personal judgment _alone_ to pick candidates (rather than agreeing on a scorecard), leaving no standardisation of assessments, and no documenting of lessons learned after the candidate had started their role.

#### Solution

I took the inputs and redesigned the process, structures for creating job descriptions and uplifting the recruitment marketing.
