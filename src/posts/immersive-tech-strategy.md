  plainTextTitle: Overview
  bodyContent: 'A utilities company has over 2000 employees that work in highly specialised
    and compliance heavy work. They are required to put safety first, with compliance
    training that is regulated by a third party. Our client was considering using
    immersive learning technologies to better improve the retention and access to
    important knowledge. However, they lacked the expertise to understand how they
    could assess the suitability of this technology.'

  plainTextTitle: Approach
  bodyContent: 'We ran a number of stakeholder interviews and desktop research to further
    understand the training use cases and potential applications with technology.
    We prioritised the use cases and dug deeper into implementation costs in order
    to form a roadmap. I led the technical track, including implementation research.'

  bodyContent: 'Co-developed the Immersive Learning strategy and validation framework,
    producing a number of educational and diagnostic assets for the client to assess
    different types of Extended Reality (i.e. AR, VR, MR) technologies to use in their
    internal training. The client has since used our prioritisation framework to successfully
    allocate a budget of $500k to create a VR learning experienced pilot.'
