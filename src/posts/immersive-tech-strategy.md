  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>We ran a number of stakeholder interviews and desktop research
    to further understand the training use cases and potential applications with technology.
    We prioritised the use cases and dug deeper into implementation costs in order
    to form a roadmap. I led the technical track, including implementation research.</p>"
- title: "<p>Outcome</p>"
  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>Co-developed the Immersive Learning strategy and validation framework,
    producing a number of educational and diagnostic assets for the client to assess
    different types of Extended Reality (i.e. AR, VR, MR) technologies to use in their
    internal training. The client has since used our prioritisation framework to successfully
    allocate a budget of $500k to create a VR learning experienced pilot.</p><p><br></p>"
overview: "<p>A utilities company has over 2000 employees that work in highly specialised
  and compliance heavy work. They are required to put safety first, with compliance
  training that is regulated by a third party. Our client was considering using immersive
  learning technologies to better improve the retention and access to important knowledge.
  However, they lacked the expertise to understand how they could assess the suitability
  of this technology.</p>"
