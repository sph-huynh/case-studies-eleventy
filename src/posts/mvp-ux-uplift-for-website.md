maintag: Rapid UX Research & Design
challenge: How might we refresh the website, to target a different audience?
overview: "<p>The website in its current state had a mixture of ‘target audiences’:
  general public, program applicants, donors, and partners. In a two rapid sprints,
  I had to identify and implement what could be changed in order to target a 'donor'
  persona.</p>"

  textcontent: "<p>Due to the very short amount of time, I had to pick and choose
    the activities that would give me the most ROI. First, I looked to understand
    what a 'donor' would look for - so contacting people who dealt with investment
    decisions in their jobs. Secondly, I did a number of usability testing to help
    point out structural and copy issues.  </p>"
