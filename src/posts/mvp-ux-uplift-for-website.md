title: MVP UX uplift for website
maintag: Rapid UX Research & Design
challenge: How might we refresh the website, to target a different audience?
overview: "<p>The website in its current state had a mixture of ‘target audiences’:
  general public, program applicants, donors, and partners. In a two rapid sprints,
  I had to identify and implement what could be changed in order to target a 'donor'
  persona.</p>"
whatstatement: Through rapid design sprints, uplifted and simplified a website.

  textcontent: "<p>Due to the very short amount of time, I had to pick and choose
    the activities that would give me the most ROI. First, I looked to understand
    what a 'donor' would look for - so contacting people who dealt with investment
    decisions in their jobs. Secondly, I did a number of usability testing to help
    point out structural and copy issues.  </p>"

  subtitle: Why usability testing? Why investment decision makers?
  textcontent: "<p>We knew that the website did not effectively target donors (content-wise),
    but we also knew that the website's language was full of jargon and difficult
    to understand. Due to the lack of time, I had to find speedier ways to identify
    the MVP changes: <em>what value we needed to show</em>? <em>what about the website
    was hard to understand?</em></p>"
- title: "<p>Outcome</p>"
  subtitle: ''
  textcontent: "<p>My website uplift focused on two elements:</p><ul><li><p>Simplifying
    the content (allowing donors to more easily understand the content)</p></li><li><p>Shifting
    the website from text-focused content to visual-focused (making it easier to understand
    what the purpose of the organisation was)</p></li></ul>"

  textcontent: "<ul><li><p>Simplifying the content allowed us to direct users to the
    content we wanted them to see (i.e. about -&gt; impact -&gt; activities). This
    would allow potential donors to better understand what they would be investing
    in.</p></li></ul>"
