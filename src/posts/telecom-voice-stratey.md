  textcontent: "<p>We delivered personas, service maps and customer insights that
    allowed our client to validate customer needs and priorities - mitigating the
    risk of implementing a technical solution that ultimately customers did not want.</p>"
overview: "<p>A Telecoms client was looking to improve their voice experience, focusing
  on voice authentication. The voice experience (phone call support) was often the
  only touchpoint customers had with the client - and we found it also played a big
  role in determining their perception of the quality of service. There were a number
  of technical solutions available, but we needed to determine what the clientâ€™s operations
  could support, what the customers needed, and how to up-skill call centre agents.</p>"
