  bodyContent: We delivered personas, service maps and customer insights that allowed
    our client to validate customer needs and priorities - mitigating the risk of
    implementing a technical solution that ultimately customers did not want.

  bodyContent: A Telecoms client was looking to improve their voice experience, focusing
    on voice authentication. The voice experience (phone call support) was often the
    only touchpoint customers had with the client - and we found it also played a
    big role in determining their perception of the quality of service. <br><br>There
    were a number of technical solutions available, but we needed to determine what
    the clientâ€™s operations could support, what the customers need, and how to up-skill
    call centre agents.
