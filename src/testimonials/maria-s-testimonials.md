title: Maria's testimonials
quote: We were looking to build a website template to support our Network Managers.
  They often lacked the time and marketing expertise to focus on their online presence.<br>Sophia
  brilliantly worked closely with our Network Managers to understand the nuances in
  their marketing challenges. She not only created a fantastic website template -
  but also a variety of tailored and simplified material - to reduce the effort needed
  to market their networks.
