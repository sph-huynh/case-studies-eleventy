  plainTextTitle: '..jack of all trades, but master of none?'
  bodyContent: "My skillsets are actually a lot more related than you'd think ðŸ¤”<br><br><ul>
<li><b>UI Design and Org Operations</b> - both are enhanced when created with modular and scalable principles from <b>Software Development / Architecture</b></li>
<li><b>Product</b>, much like <b>Strategy</b> benefits from decision-making with intuition anchored in facts</li>
<li><b>UX, Narratives, Copy, and Communications</b> - are all similar to <b>Experience Design</b> in crafting actions / features / messaging for a specific audience, surfacing the right answer to their needs and challenges</li>
</ul>
